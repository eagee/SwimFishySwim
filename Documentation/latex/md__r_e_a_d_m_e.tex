Swim Fishy Swim is a now defunct Wii Homebrew project (back when everything was 4\+:3 and Unity3d was only on Macs). The project compiles to a rom capable of running in an SD card on the wii using the \href{https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Main_Page}{\texttt{ Wii\+Brew}} toolchain.

Footage of the actual (admittedly rather odd but fun) gameplay can be found here\+: \href{https://youtu.be/giIlyl0D9iA}{\texttt{ }}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysection{SFS Games Design Document (\+GDD)}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsubsection{Background (why we are doing this)\+:}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
Possessing the skill set and experience in requisite parts to make what we believe could be great games, the Green Door Games team has decided to embark on a test of those skills. Specifically, to author and complete a video game, and (if possible) release it on one or more platforms.

Aside from a deep love of video games and the desire to create, the major motivation for this project stems from a \char`\"{}\+Desire to continue living\char`\"{}. This motivation may seem confusing until one attempts any major home repair project with our lead developer. Therefore the specific metric for success of this project has been specified by his spouse as, \char`\"{}\+Make enough money to re-\/do the kitchen, and you\textquotesingle{}ll never have to do a major home repair again.\char`\"{}

All joking aside, the true goal of this and future projects is to create a company that breaks the norm of the industry.

The long term goal of this project is to create a company that focuses on fun, creativity, stability, social responsibility, and community involvement (e.\+g. we\textquotesingle{}d like our company to make enough money to allow us to do some volunteer work teaching inner city kids how to write software. The hope of this particular goal is that the encouragement of software development skills (not necessarily games, but games as a draw for young, bright minds) in the hopes that such a low overhead skill can lead to life and community changing experiences).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{Scope\+:}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
The scope of this document should be limited to high level design decisions associated with Swim Fishy Swim. This includes general level design, general character/behavior description, menus, and descriptions of overall system functionality. Any low level implementation decisions, sales and marketing decisions, or graphic presentation decisions are outside the scope of this document and should be specified in other parts of the wiki.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{Audience\+:}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
The audience for this document is generally going to be a technically savvy individual, most likely associated with Green Door Games, LLC as a company. The technical details of the document will mostly focus on how the product is used by the player as is common in a Use Case driven development methodology.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{Conventions\+:}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
This document lays out an overall design specification based on two primary analysis tools\+:

{\bfseries{The use case}}\+: \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20120323054600/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case}{\texttt{ http\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Use\+\_\+case}}

{\bfseries{The use case diagram}}\+: \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20120323054600/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case_diagram}{\texttt{ http\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+Use\+\_\+case\+\_\+diagram}}

Generally, this type of \char`\"{}use case driven\char`\"{} methodology depends upon use cases to describe overall systems, and then depends on analysis of those use cases to break down a system design at the code level.

The use cases in the document will intentionally include as little design specification as possible. We will also be omitting use case elements other than steps unless that information is actually outside of what would be considered shared common knowledge (e.\+g. Trigger\+: \char`\"{}\+User Turns on Video Game System\char`\"{} is implied, everyone knows you have to do it -\/ so it doesn\textquotesingle{}t need to be written down).

This document will generally adhere to the following layout\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The Solution (e.\+g. Swim Fishy Swim)
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Solution Requirements
\item Solution Actors
\item Solution Use Cases
\item Systems that make up the solution \+\_\+(there can be 1..n of these!)\+\_\+

\item etc...
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The breakout between each System allows the design to tackle small parts of the problem at a time. Use cases for the most part should be sufficient to describe game interactions, however map and character design may include mockup graphics as well.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsubsection{Game Story\+:}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}
