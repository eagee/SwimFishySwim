SwimFishySwim
=============

Swim Fishy Swim is a now defunct Wii Homebrew project (back when everything was 4:3 and Unity3d was only on Macs). The project compiles to a rom capable of running in an SD card on the wii the XYZ toolchain.



Footage of the actual (admittedly rather odd but fun) gameplay can be found here:
